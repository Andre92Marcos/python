Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. 

Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands.


Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. 

It can be used to automate setup scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It can be used for automated software testing. 


**pxSSH**

This class extends pexpect.spawn to specialize setting up SSH connections. This adds methods for login, logout and expecting the shell prompt
